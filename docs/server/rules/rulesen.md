## <a id="1"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">CAP. 1 - INTRODUCTION</span>

### <a id="1.1"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">1.1 Regulation Agreement</span>

By connecting to the server, you directly agree to comply with the server rules. You are required to read and to comply with the rules, otherwise, you risk sanctions for each violation.

### <a id="1.2"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">1.2 Regulation Interpretation</span>

Interpretation of any rule is prohibited! You cannot interpret any rule for your convenience to gain advantages in RolePlay. 

For any unclear aspects regarding the rules & regulations, contact a staff member. In ticket situations, the identification of any violations is made by the staff member who took over the ticket and not by the players.

### <a id="1.3"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">1.3 Conditions to Play on the Server</span>

- RolePlaying as the opposite sex of the player's real sex is not allowed.
- A functional microphone is required to communicate with other players.
- Roleplay names - Using names of famous people, or names with the intent of trolling, are prohibited. Names can be real or invented by you and should be found in everyday life.

Examples of prohibited names: Mickael Jackson / Jhon Coa*eLungi / MaJocBine

Examples of allowed names: Mihai Ionescu / Michael Aoki / Laurentiu Lautaru

Non-compliance or non-cooperation with the server administration to respect any of the above parameters will lead to your account being permanently banned, with the possibility to create another account later.

### <a id="1.4"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">1.4 Player Behavior and Exclusion Policy (ZT)</span>

The Administration Team reserves the right to permanently remove players from the server who are ruining the game experience for other users. This right is also called Zero Tolerance (ZT). The team evaluates the attitude, behavior, toxicity and other relevant aspects of players. Our goal is to maintain a pleasant environment for all users, and people who cause problems will be excluded.

Players who accumulate a lot of sanctions in a short period of time, who have toxic behavior or who disrupt the game experience may be sanctioned with a permanent ban with no payment option.

### <a id="1.5"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">1.5 Obligation to Record AUDIO-VIDEO Footage</span>  

To ensure fairness and transparency in Roleplay sessions, all players are required to constantly record their gameplay in the form of AUDIO-VIDEO footage.  

<span style="color:yellowgreen">✔ **Specific Rules:** </span>  
- The recording must include both video and audio to be used as evidence in case of complaints.
- Recordings must be kept for a minimum period of **72 hours** from the moment of the game session.
- The recording must be of reasonable quality (without excessive lag, clear and intelligible sound).
- It is forbidden to modify, cut, or alter the recording in a way that may distort the truth.

<span style="color:red">⚠ **Sanctions:** </span>  
- The absence of a valid recording in the event of a complaint may result in **the cancellation of one's own evidence** and **possible sanctions**.
- If a player refuses or cannot provide the footage in a situation where it is requested, he cannot claim his innocence and may be sanctioned. Ex: If you are accused by MetaGaming and you do not have the footage to prove otherwise, you will be sanctioned for MG.

### <a id="1.6"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">1.6 False Reports and Posthunt</span>

Filing multiple unfounded reports against players, especially when they do not explicitly violate the rules or disrupt the RP experience, is not allowed.

<span style="color: yellow">Examples of posthunt:</span>
- Persistently seeking the punishment of a player at any cost, even if their actions did not significantly impact the outcome of the RP scenario you were involved in.
- Creating multiple complaints against a player who is repeatedly found not guilty of breaking any rules.

Before submitting a report or ticket, think carefully. If your complaint is baseless and solely intended to get someone punished, you may be the one penalized for posthunt.

<span style="color: red">Sanctions:</span>

- First offense: 150-200 Checkpoints 
- Second offense: Warn
- Three or more offenses: Ban 1-7 zile up to Permanent ban in some cases

- The Syndicate has the right to use OOC information/evidence to initiate RP scenarios, investigations, or interventions.
- If an official or unofficial mafia abuses disguise systems to carry out unauthorized robberies, the Syndicate may use OOC information to validate its suspicions.
- Syndicate-organized actions are not limited by other general rules in the server regulations, as long as their purpose is maintaining order, preventing abuse, or investigating suspicious factions.
- The Syndicate does not use OOC-acquired information to intervene in conflicts between mafias, but solely to maintain a healthy roleplay order throughout the city.

## <a id="2"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">CAP. 2 - BASIC RULES</span>

### <a id="2.1"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">2.1 In Character (IC)</span>

Represents all actions made by a player/character during roleplay. It is the opposite of the Out-Of-Character (OOC) meaning.

<span style="color: yellow">Example:</span> I created an account and a character, and everything I see and hear in the game are IC actions. Any other information observed or heard on the game chat, Discord, YouTube, etc., are not considered IC information, but OOC.

The roleplay progresses, and eventually, these people kill you. You respawn at the hospital, and you must forget all the information from the last roleplay.

<span style="color: green">Notes:</span>  
- When you leave any government organization (Police or Medical) or their respective departments, you are required to forget all the specific details related to those organizations/departments (information about their members, actions, or any information acquired during your time of service within them). The only thing you are allowed to remember is the fact that you were once part of that organization/department.
- When a mafia/group leader kills a member, the latter will forget all the information they know about that organization or any other organizations they have interacted with, essentially forgetting their mafia life. Also, the mafia leader and all the present people will forget all the information about the murdered person.
- When an organization (official or unofficial) is disbanded, PK is applied to all its members. They forget all the information they knew about that organization or any other organizations they interacted with, essentially forgetting their mafia lives. If the mafia was recognized by the Syndicate, they will forget everything about the Syndicate as well.

---

#### <a id="7.8.1"></a><span style="color:green; font-size: 20px;">7.8.1 GREEN ZONES/ROADS</span>
Green zones and roads are public areas, frequented by many people and usually monitored by surveillance cameras. In those areas committing illegal activities is not allowed. The regulation of <a href="#7.3">#7.3 Illegalities in Public Areas</a> applies here.

---

#### <a id="7.8.2"></a><span style="color:red; font-size: 20px;">7.8.2 RED ZONES</span>
Red Zones are notorious areas and dangerous parts of the city or outside the city where many illegal activities can happen, but not near businesses (examples: gas stations, barbershops, stores, workplaces, parking lots, clubs - marked on the map).

The following are allowed between <span style="color:yellowgreen">**8:00 PM - 8:00 AM**</span> or <span style="color:yellowgreen">**6:00 PM - 10:00 AM**</span> on **Cayo Island**:

- Opening fire based on a previous roleplay or a very good reasoning (Example: You control the Grove area and a rival mafia enters your territory, you have the right to open fire on them)

---

#### <a id="7.8.3"></a><span style="color:yellow; font-size: 20px;">7.8.3 YELLOW ZONES/ROADS</span>
Yellow zones and roads are semi-public or semi-notorious areas that mark the transition between a public area and a dangerous one. In these areas, illegal activities are committed at your own risk. It is allowed to kidnap or use weapons for kidnappings, but robberies are prohibited. To kill someone in these areas, you must have a solid reason. These roads are usually frequently traveled, so there is a risk of being seen committing illegal activities, which we want to avoid. Yellow zones are near notorious areas, so it is recommended to kidnap from the yellow zone and move to the notorious areas to continue the roleplay (RP).

The following are allowed between <span style="color:yellowgreen">**8:00 PM - 8:00 AM**</span>:
- Taking hostages or kidnapping citizens based on a previous roleplay or a very good reasoning
- Opening fire based on previous roleplay or a very well-founded reason.
**<span style="color:red">BEING STOPPED AT A TRAFIC STOP IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO OPEN FIRE ON THE COP</span>**

#### <a id="7.8.4"></a><span style="color:gray; font-size: 20px;">7.8.4 GRAY ZONES / RED ROADS</span>
These are unpopulated areas or roads where illegal activities are permitted. Pretty much, these are roads that have not been marked on the map above with any color, alleys between buildings, roads through the mountains, or on the edge of the map.

---

<span style="color: green">Mentions and Exceptions:</span>
- There is no abuse of the green zone. Once an action begins in a red, grey, or red road area, you are allowed to continue it in a green or yellow zone. It’s important to note that the only illegal action permitted in green zones is **KIDNAPPING**, and only outside government institutions (City Hall, Police Station, Hospital, etc.). In this case, kidnapping in green zones must not exceed 5 minutes. Otherwise, it falls under the <a href="#7.6">#7.6 Terrorist Actions</a> rule. Kidnapping in a green zone can only occur if no more than 10 minutes have passed since the last interaction between the involved parties, and the action must have started in a high-crime area.

- Between green zones, there are certain secluded areas (e.g., Rockford area – between buildings, behind buildings). If you manage to lure another player there, you may kidnap, rob, or kill them. Between the buildings in green zones, the alleys apply grey zone rules.

- On yellow streets in high-crime zones, robbery is prohibited in that exact perimeter. The robbery must be moved to the high-crime zone itself, not on the semi-public road. On yellow roads in high-crime areas, the following are allowed regardless of time: hostage-taking and opening fire based on prior roleplay and a well-founded reason (no traffic stops).

- The rule of illegality in public areas (for businesses: gas stations, garages, salons, ATMs, etc.) applies regardless of whether it’s a red, yellow, or grey zone. You still can’t rob someone at a gas station even if it's located in Grove. The only exception is when the action started in a high-crime area and there is a valid reason.

- If a conflict action (fight between two groups using lethal weapons) starts in a red, grey, or red road area, you may continue it on highways outside the city, **except** for areas around borders (from the border, toward the border, or with a border between the fighting camps).

- In general, you must be cautious in the areas where you commit illegal actions: they should not be trafficked by people or vehicles, should not have surveillance cameras, and should not be near police stations. Practically, illegal actions are allowed in secluded and hidden areas. Note: you are not allowed to kidnap someone in a green zone and then take them between buildings for robbery or murder—try to lure them into such zones instead.

<span style="color: green">Examples:</span><br>
<span style="color: yellowgreen">Allowed:</span> 
- A conflict starts in the Grove area between multiple individuals. One of them escapes into a green zone and is followed. The escaping person can be quickly kidnapped from the green zone (kidnapping can last up to 5 minutes).

<span style="color: red">Not Allowed:</span> 
- A conflict starts at a plantation between multiple people. One of them leaves and is identified hours later in a green zone. Kidnapping is not allowed from the green zone because more than 10 minutes have passed since the last interaction.

Violation of the above time intervals and the failure of following the rules will be <span style="color: red">sanctioned</span> with:
- first offense: 50-100 Checkpoints
- second offense: 200 Checkpoints
- three or more offenses: warning

Civilians present during the robbery cannot be robbed, kidnapped or killed, but must be forced to leave the area. Civilians who do not comply with the directives to leave the store can be killed.

If a robbery starts with fewer than 8 participants, other people can join up to the maximum number (8). For example: the robbery starts in 2 people, a maximum of 8 more people can be called for reinforcements.

A person who has accepted death cannot be replaced by another colleague in the robbery.

During the robbery, you cannot have a hostage because the focus is exclusively on robbing a store.

The store doors cannot be blocked with vehicles, both by robbers and policemen. This action can lead to sanctioning according to the rule of <a href="#2.13">#2.13 PowerGaming (PG)</a>.
