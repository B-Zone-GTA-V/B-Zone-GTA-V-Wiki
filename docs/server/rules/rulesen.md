#### <a id="7.8.1"></a><span style="color:green; font-size: 20px;">7.8.1 GREEN ZONES/ROADS</span>
Green zones and roads are public areas, frequented by many people and usually monitored by surveillance cameras. In those areas committing illegal activities is not allowed. The regulation of <a href="#7.3">#7.3 Illegalities in Public Areas</a> applies here.

---

#### <a id="7.8.2"></a><span style="color:red; font-size: 20px;">7.8.2 RED ZONES</span>
Red Zones are notorious areas and dangerous parts of the city or outside the city where many illegal activities can happen, but not near businesses (examples: gas stations, barbershops, stores, workplaces, parking lots, clubs - marked on the map).

The following are allowed between <span style="color:yellowgreen">**8:00 PM - 8:00 AM**</span>:
- Robbing people, vehicles, plants or any kind of stealing/robbing

---

#### <a id="7.8.3"></a><span style="color:yellow; font-size: 20px;">7.8.3 YELLOW ZONES/ROADS</span>
Yellow zones and roads are semi-public or semi-notorious areas that mark the transition between a public area and a dangerous one. In these areas, illegal activities are committed at your own risk. It is allowed to kidnap or use weapons for kidnappings, but robberies are prohibited. To kill someone in these areas, you must have a solid reason. These roads are usually frequently traveled, so there is a risk of being seen committing illegal activities, which we want to avoid. Yellow zones are near notorious areas, so it is recommended to kidnap from the yellow zone and move to the notorious areas to continue the roleplay (RP).

The following are allowed between <span style="color:yellowgreen">**8:00 PM - 8:00 AM**</span>:
- Taking hostages or kidnapping citizens based on a previous roleplay or a very good reasoning
- Opening fire based on previous roleplay or a very well-founded reason.
**<span style="color:red">BEING STOPPED AT A TRAFIC STOP IS NOT A GOOD ENOUGH REASON TO OPEN FIRE ON THE COP</span>**

Between <span style="color:yellowgreen">**8:01 AM - 7:59 PM**</span>:

#### <a id="7.8.4"></a><span style="color:gray; font-size: 20px;">7.8.4 GRAY ZONES / RED ROADS</span>
These are unpopulated areas or roads where illegal activities are permitted. Pretty much, these are roads that have not been marked on the map above with any color, alleys between buildings, roads through the mountains, or on the edge of the map.

The following are allowed in the cities between <span style="color:yellowgreen">**8:00 PM - 8:00 AM**</span>:

- Opening fire based on previous roleplay or a very well-founded reason.

In the cities between <span style="color:yellowgreen">**8:01 AM - 7:59 PM**</span>:
- The regulation of <a href="#7.3">#7.3 Illegalities in Public Areas</a> applies<br><br>

<span style="color:gray; font-size: 18px;">Outside the cities</span>

The following are allowed in the cities between <span style="color:yellowgreen">**8:00 PM - 8:00 AM**</span>:

---

<span style="color: green">Notes and Exceptions:</span>
- There is no abuse of the green zone. Once an action starts in a red area, gray, or red roads, you have the right to continue it in the green or yellow zone. It should be noted that in green zones, the only illegal action allowed is kidnapping outside government institutions (City Hall, Police Station, Hospital, etc.). In this case, kidnapping in the green zones is not allowed to last more than 5 minutes; otherwise, the rule of <a href="#7.6">#7.6 Terrorist Actions</a> will apply. Kidnapping from the green zone can only take place if no more than 10 minutes have passed since the last interaction between the parties involved, which started in a notorious area.

Allowed example: A conflict between several people started in the Grove area. One of the people manages to escape into the green area, being pursued. The escaped person can be kidnapped from the green zone quickly (the kidnapping action can last a maximum of 5 minutes).

Illegal example: On a plantation, a conflict started between several people. One of the people leaves and is identified a few hours later in a green area. You are unable to kidnap from green zone because more than 10 minutes have passed in which green zone kidnapping is allowed.

- Between the green zones, there are certain secluded areas (e.g., the Rockford area - between blocks, behind buildings). If you manage to lure another player there, you can kidnap, rob, or kill them. Essentially, the Gray Zone rule applies.

- On yellow streets in notorious areas, it is forbidden to rob in that exact perimeter. Robbing should be moved to a notorious area, not the semi-public street. On the yellow roads in the infamous areas, the following are allowed regardless of the time: taking a hostage and opening fire based on a previous roleplay and a very well-founded reason (no traffic-stop).

- The rule of illegality in a public area (for businesses: gas stations, garages, salons, ATMs and others) applies regardless of whether it is a red, yellow or gray area. You still can't rob someone at the gas station even if it's in the Grove. The only exception is when the action started from the notorious area and you have a good reason. If you are followed by the police while delivering drugs it is considered a good reason and you are allowed to open fire, even in public areas within red or yellow zones.

<span style="color: green">Examples:</span>
- An action starts in the notorious Labirint area and extends towards Mirror or the highway. This will not be considered an illegal activity in the public area, as the action started in a notorious area and moved to a public area.

- In general, you must be careful in the areas where you commit illegal activities, ensuring they are not frequented by people or vehicles, do not have surveillance cameras, and are not near a police station. Practically, illegal activities are permitted in secluded and hidden areas. Attention, you are not allowed to kidnap from the green zone and take between buildings for robbery or murder; try to lure people into these areas.

Violation of the above time intervals and the failure of following the rules will be <span style="color: red">sanctioned</span> with:
- first offense: 50-100 Checkpoints
- second offense: 200 Checkpoints

Robbing stores can be done with at least one firearm, at any time, in a group of at least 2, maximum 8 people only if all the participants in the robbery have at least 50 hours.

After the alarm is triggered, the store's vicinity becomes a red zone until the action is concluded and the police leave. Civilians present during the robbery cannot be robbed or killed, but must be forced to leave the area. Civilians who do not comply with the directives to leave the store can be killed.

If a robbery starts with fewer than 8 participants, other people can join up to the maximum number (8). For example: the robbery starts in 2 people, a maximum of 8 more people can be called for reinforcements.

A person who has accepted death cannot be replaced by another colleague in the robbery.

During the robbery, you cannot have a hostage because the focus is exclusively on robbing a store.

The store doors cannot be blocked with vehicles, both by robbers and policemen. This action can lead to sanctioning according to the rule of <a href="#2.13">#2.13 PowerGaming (PG)</a>.

#### <a id="7.10.2"></a><span style="color: #0088CC">7.10.2 Banks</span>

A person who has accepted death cannot be replaced by another colleague in the robbery.

During the robbery, you cannot have a hostage because the focus is exclusively on robbing a bank. We want to avoid ticket situations in which the same person could be taken hostage several times or tickets for non-compliance with the negotiated conditions.

Another group of people cannot step in to kill the robbers or take the control of the robbery.

The player who starts the robbery needs a minimum of 500 playing hours.

After the robbery is over and the area is neutralized, the police will need to shut down the bank's security systems.
